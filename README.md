## e-bookstore  

This is a small program potentially for a book seller to track books. The code uses SQLITE to create database called 'ebookstore' 
and a table called 'books' and adds some values to the table. 
User is presented with the table and then can choose from Main Menu to: 
1. Enter book
2. Update book
3. Delete book
4. Search book
0. Exit
